# 03 — Metrics: formulas and examples

All metrics are integers, computable from cached Apple responses. Recomputing from the cache always yields the same result. Weights come from `aso.config.json` (the formulas below use the defaults).

Keyword normalization before any computation: `lowercase → trim → collapse repeated spaces → NFC`. Duplicates after normalization — a single keyword.

## 3.1 Popularity (P), 0–100 — demand proxy from autocomplete suggestions

**Intuition:** the shorter the prefix at which Apple already suggests the phrase, and the higher it sits in the suggestion list — the more often it is searched. That is precisely the signal Apple ranks suggestions by.

**Probing procedure for keyword K of length N characters:**
1. Request suggestions for prefixes `K[0:i]`, i = 1, 2, 3, … N (each request is cached — prefixes are reused across keywords, so the real cost drops quickly).
2. **L** = the minimum prefix length at which K appears in the suggestions (exact match after normalization). **rank** = K's position in the list at that prefix (1..10).
3. Early stop: as soon as K is found — stop (prefixes longer than L are not needed).
4. If K never appeared at any prefix up to i = N → P = 0, flag `unsuggested: true`.

**Formula** (N ≥ 2; N = 1 cannot occur — single-letter keywords do not exist, the minimum word length in hypotheses is 3 characters):

```
DepthScore = (N − L) / (N − 1)          // L=1 → 1.0; L=N → 0.0
RankScore  = (11 − rank) / 10           // rank 1 → 1.0; rank 10 → 0.1
P = round(100 × (0.7 × DepthScore + 0.3 × RankScore))
```

**Example:** K = `habit tracker`, N = 13. The phrase appeared in the suggestions at prefix `habi` (L = 4) at position 2.
DepthScore = (13−4)/12 = 0.75; RankScore = (11−2)/10 = 0.9; P = round(100 × (0.7×0.75 + 0.3×0.9)) = round(79.5) = **80**.

**Additional signal (stored, not part of P):** `childCount` — how many suggestions for the query `K + " "` start with K (how many "children" the phrase spawns). An indicator of long-tail potential, shown in the UI, used by the pipeline to pick expansion directions (`04-pipeline.md`).

## 3.2 Difficulty (D), 0–100 — competition strength from search results

**Intuition:** search results are hard to beat when the top is occupied by apps with a large volume of ratings, high scores, fresh updates, and an exact keyword match in the name (i.e., they deliberately own this query).

For each app i at position i = 1..`serpTop` (default 10) of the search results for K:

```
V = min(1, log10(userRatingCount + 1) / 6)        // volume: 1M+ ratings → 1.0
Q = averageUserRating / 5                          // quality
F = max(0, 1 − daysSince(currentVersionReleaseDate) / 365)   // freshness
M = 1.0  if K is contained whole in trackName (substring, case-insensitive)
    0.5  if all words of K appear in trackName in any order
    0.0  otherwise
AppStrength_i = 100 × (0.45×V + 0.15×Q + 0.15×F + 0.25×M)
```

Positional weights (the top of the results matters more): `w_i = (serpTop + 1 − i) / Σ` (for serpTop=10: 10/55, 9/55, … 1/55).

```
D_raw = Σ w_i × AppStrength_i
n     = actual number of results (resultCount, capped at serpTop)
D     = round(D_raw × n / serpTop)     // few results = weak niche → D drops
```

Also stored: `resultCount` of the full query (limit=25) as `serpSize` — a niche saturation indicator for the UI.

**Example:** competitor #1 — 250,000 ratings, score 4.7, updated 30 days ago, K whole in the name:
V = log10(250001)/6 = 0.90; Q = 0.94; F = 1−30/365 = 0.92; M = 1.0
AppStrength = 100 × (0.45×0.90 + 0.15×0.94 + 0.15×0.92 + 0.25×1.0) = **93**.
If all ten look like this — D ≈ 93 (a bloodbath). If after the top 3 come dead apps with no ratings or updates — D drops to 40–50, and that is an honest "you can squeeze in here" signal.

## 3.3 Relevance (R), 0–3 — the only LLM metric, by rubric

Assigned by the built-in LLM via the batch call `rate` (contract in `06-llm-adapters.md`), which receives the business context and a batch of verified keywords. The rubric is strict and embedded in the prompt verbatim:

| R | Criterion |
|---|---|
| 3 | The query describes the CORE of the product: a user searching for this is looking for exactly this kind of app |
| 2 | An adjacent job: our app solves it, but it is not its main function |
| 1 | A tangential overlap: some of the searchers might be satisfied with our app |
| 0 | Irrelevant or matches the anti-semantics from aso-context.md → excluded |

`reason` is mandatory (non-empty), stored in state, shown in the UI next to the score; the entire LLM call itself (prompt + response) is available in the LLM call log. This makes the LLM's judgment human-verifiable. Keywords matching the anti-semantics from the context must receive R=0.

### 3.3v2 Relevance is computed, not asked (supersedes the per-keyword final rating)

The rubric above stayed the **prescreen** — a purely semantic, pre-measurement gate — but the *final* R is no longer a second per-keyword LLM opinion. That call was the least reproducible number in the system: its output moved with batch composition (±33% of Score on a 2↔3 flip) and differed run-to-run for the same keyword; it over-rated word salad and under-rated real cores, because "is this query core or adjacent?" asked in isolation is inherently subjective.

Final R decomposes into the two factors it always meant, only one of which is semantic:

- **semantic prior** `sem ∈ {0,1,2,3}` — the prescreen rating (the LLM judges the query's intent once, before measurement). Unchanged.
- **store fit** `serpFit ∈ [0,1]` — MEASURED: the positionally-weighted share of the query's top-`serpTop` SERP that sits in our niche. Each SERP app is niche-classified **once per run** (`match ∈ {0, 0.5, 1}`, LLM task `classify`, cached in `state.appNiche` keyed by trackId) and reused by every keyword whose results include it. "Is this OUR kind of app?" is far more reproducible than rating each query, and one verdict serves dozens of keywords — so R stops drifting between keywords and between runs. The same niche map feeds the Competitors tab.

```
serpFit = Σ_i  posWeight(i) · match(app_i)        // posWeight mirrors D: (serpTop−i)/Σ
conf    = min(1, observed / serpTop)              // thin SERP → low confidence
fitAdj  = conf · serpFit + (1 − conf) · (sem/3)   // scarce evidence blends back to the prior
R       = 3 · (sem/3)^0.6 · fitAdj^0.4            // 0–3, one decimal; sem=0 ⇒ 0 (anti-semantics)
```

R is continuous. Keywords with `R ≥ 1` are included (charged, enter the sample and assembly); below 1 they are excluded (not charged). The `reason` is code-generated and fully traceable: `"R 2.8 = semantic 3/3 × store-fit 85%. <prescreen reason>"`, with the classified top SERP available behind it. There is **no per-keyword final `rate` call** — the only LLM query-judgement is the prescreen. Implementation: `core/metrics/relevance.ts`, `prompts/classify.md`.

## 3.4 Opportunity Score, 0–100 — final strength

```
Score = round(100 × (P/100)^0.6 × ((100 − D)/100)^0.4 × (R/3))
```

The power form: both factors must be non-zero (a popular but impenetrable query ≈ useless; an empty but easy one — likewise), and the exponents 0.6/0.4 prioritize demand. R is a linear multiplier: adjacent queries (R=2) lose a third of their strength. (With R now continuous per 3.3v2, `R/3` is evaluated directly — e.g. R=2.8 → ×0.933.)

**Examples:**
- P=80, D=70, R=3 → 100 × 0.8^0.6 × 0.3^0.4 × 1 = 100 × 0.875 × 0.618 = **54**
- P=35, D=25, R=3 → 100 × 0.533 × 0.891 × 1 = **47** — modest demand with weak competition nearly catches up with a hyped query dominated by giants. This is the workhorse of indie ASO; the formula is deliberately built that way.
- P=80, D=70, R=1 → 54 × 1/3 = **18** — hype without relevance yields nothing: users who install via an irrelevant query don't convert and hurt the behavioral metrics.

Tie-breaks at equal Score (for sorting and selection): higher P → lower D → shorter K.

**Keywords with P=0** (`unsuggested`): Score = 0, they do not enter greedy selection, but are NOT deleted — they are a speculative reserve for topping up the keyword field (see `05-assembly.md`, the "speculative top-up" step).
